# slack_chrome_ext

This repo can be anything.. If you want it to be the playground to try things here and there, feel free to create a directory with your name. :)

Once we are ready with the tools, requirements, plants / strategies to produce something. Let's retstucture this repo. And make sure to create a PR everytime we want to make improvements or changes.

Also, 
Please constantly update this README with the description of the project, goals, etc..

Happy coding! :nerd_face:
